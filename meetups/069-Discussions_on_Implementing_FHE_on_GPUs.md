# Abstract

In this new format, we discuss the topic of implementing FHE on GPUs with the community, answer questions, and share ideas.

# About the speaker

Agnès is a software engineer and expert in GPU programming currently working as GPU Director at Zama.

She started out as a researcher in Computational Fluid Dynamics, where she worked on the GPU acceleration of a particle-based simulation method. She is the author of several publications in this field, and won several awards in the course of her PhD. After a few years contributing to various open source software projects, Agnès decided to focus on software development.

Before joining Zama, Agnès worked at EDF (Electricity of France) as a researcher, then at RTE (France's Transmission System Operator) as a software developer. She holds a Mechanical Engineering degree from Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and a Civil engineering degree from Universidade de Minas Gerais (Brazil). She also holds a PhD from Université Paris-Est.
