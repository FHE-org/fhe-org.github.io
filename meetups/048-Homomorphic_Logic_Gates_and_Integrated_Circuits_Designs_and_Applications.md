# Abstract

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows for the direct evaluation of arbitrary computations over encrypted inputs. Specifically, Boolean circuits can be evaluated over encrypted bits based on homomorphic gate constructions. However, due to the inherent complexity of the cryptographic primitives, how to design optimized gates and circuits over FHE still remains unexplored.

In this presentation, we will introduce some of our recent works on the design and implementation of homomorphic gates and circuits, including a five-stage processor design, designs of optimized logic gates, and an automated algorithm for optimizing Boolean circuits over compound logic gates. Lastly, we wish to share some of our thoughts on the future of homomorphic circuit design.


# About the speaker

Song Bian is currently an associate professor at Beihang University. His main areas of interest include fully homomorphic encryption, privacy-preserving computing and domain-specific hardware accelerator. He has published dozens of works on top-tier conferences such as USENIX Security, ACM CCS and NDSS, and received the Distinguished Paper Award at CCS'23. He received B.S. from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014.

He received M.S. and Ph.D. from Kyoto University, in 2017 and 2019, respectively, and served as an assistant professor at Kyoto University until 2021. He served as technical committee members/reviewers for top-tier international conferences/journals across different fields of studies, including CVPR, IEEE TIFS and IEEE TCAD. He is a member of ACM and IEEE.
