![048 Meetup cover](https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io/assets/37557436/f606f3a0-2a23-4c1a-a047-86b6d3c2248a)

# Abstract

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows for the direct evaluation of arbitrary computations over encrypted inputs. Specifically, Boolean circuits can be evaluated over encrypted bits based on homomorphic gate constructions. However, due to the inherent complexity of the cryptographic primitives, how to design optimized gates and circuits over FHE still remains unexplored.

In this presentation, we will introduce some of our recent works on the design and implementation of homomorphic gates and circuits, including a five-stage processor design, designs of optimized logic gates, and an automated algorithm for optimizing Boolean circuits over compound logic gates. Lastly, we wish to share some of our thoughts on the future of homomorphic circuit design.
