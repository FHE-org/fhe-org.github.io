# Abstract

Fully Homomorphic Encryption has known impressive improvements in the last 15 years, going from a technology long thought to be impossible to an existing family of encryption schemes able to solve a plethora of practical use cases related to the privacy of sensitive information.

Recent results mainly focus on improving techniques within the traditionally defined framework of GLWE-based schemes, but the recent CPU implementation improvements are mainly incremental.
To keep improving this technology, one solution is to modify the aforementioned framework, by using slightly different hardness assumptions.

This talk addresses two limitations of (T)FHE and proposes solutions by introducing two new types of secret keys for GLWE-based cryptosystems, which can be used either separately or together.
The presentation will highlight improvements to existing FHE algorithms and introduce new algorithms that are especially efficient with these new keys.

It will also provide practical running times and comparisons with the current state of the art, showing computational speed-ups between 1.3 and 2.4 while maintaining the same level of security and failure probability (correctness)
