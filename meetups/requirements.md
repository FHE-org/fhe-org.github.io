# Meetup Requirements [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Edit%20this%20page%20on-Github-lightgrey?style=flat-square">](https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io)
  
Here are some things we'll need from any presenter for a successful meetup.

If you've already provided these, *great*! Otherwise, make sure to provide them at least **3 weeks before** the scheduled meetup to be safe to give time for preparations and announcements.

## Presenter(s) information

1. Full name(s) of all presenters
2. How each presenter wants to be referenced in announcements and during the meetup (ex. Full name, Dr. Full name, Professor Full name, etc)
3. What associations each presenter would like to claim in announcements, descriptions, and video title card (Ex. Professor/student at XYZ in ABC country, intern/researcher/CTO at XYZ company, etc).
4. Bio / info for description for each presenter
5. Photos of each presenter (highest res available, preferably min. 768 x 1024)

## Presentation Information

1. Title of your presentation/meetup (80 characters or less)
2. Category of your presentation (Research, Engineering, Hardware, Use cases)
3. Description (should explain the topic or desired outcome of the meetup). (note: write in third person perspective)
4. Link of relevant paper or poster (if applicable)
5. Discord username on the FHE.org discord server (discord.fhe.org) (so we can thank you properly afterwards!)

## Notes for the Meetup

* Arrive up to 15 minutes early for connection / equipment / screen sharing test and short interview for bonus material
* **Disable annotations on your presentation for security.**
* Introduce yourself again when recording starts for the benefit of people watching later
* Presentations should last between 15-50 minutes
* Q&A time follows from the chat and ends 60 seconds after the last question answerred. Q&A is not recorded.
* After the Q&A and meetup are completely finished, we will stay on for another 10+ minutes for a  *virtual coffee break*. Feel free to leave as you need as this portion is *not* required participation in any way, but this is time when the community gets a chance to relax, get to know each other better, and discuss other topics. It can last anywhere between 10~60 minutes.


## Post-meetup resources

After the meetup has finished, make sure to send whatever materials *(PDFs, links to demos, etc)* you used during your presentation so they can be added to the resources page for the meetup.
