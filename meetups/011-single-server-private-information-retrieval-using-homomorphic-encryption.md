![Meetup 011](https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io/assets/37557436/2a9f4e76-18c6-498a-aa13-dbbde68cb140)

# Abstract
In this talk, Haris will talk about private information retrieval (PIR) protocols based on Somewhat/Fully Homomorphic Encryption (SHE/FHE). PIR allows the client to privately retrieve a record from a database hosted at the server. He will first discuss a general framework of PIR protocols. Followed by optimizations to improve the request size, computation time, and response overhead including the results from ACM CCSâ€™21.

# The speaker
Muhammad Haris is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, advised by Ling Ren. His research interests are in applied cryptography and computer security. Recently he has been working on improving the concrete efficiency of crypto primitives like private information retrieval, private set intersection, Oram and oblivious transfer.
