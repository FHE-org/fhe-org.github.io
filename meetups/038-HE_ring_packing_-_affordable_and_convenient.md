# Abstract

Most FHE schemes can be classified as LWE-based schemes for granularity and RLWE-based schemes for throughput. Converting LWEs to RLWEs has been an interest of many works including [CGGI17], [CDKS21], and [LHH+21], but none of them properly adapted to the FHE setting. We introduce the result of our paper [BCK+23] that defines the FHE ring packing, provides optimizations, and proposes a new ring packing method.
