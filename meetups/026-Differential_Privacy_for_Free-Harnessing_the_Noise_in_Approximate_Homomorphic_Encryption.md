![026 Meetup cover](https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io/assets/37557436/0270aaef-c4a1-446c-94fd-3f984a9f84cc)

# Abstract

In this meetup, we'll make a connection between two important ideas in the Privacy Enhancing Technologies ecosystem -- Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy. While Homomorphic Encryption ensures that sensitive data is not exposed during computation, Differential Privacy guarantees that each data subject can maintain their privacy when we share the result of that computation.

During this talk, we'll look at noise growth in Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and investigate the possibility that this inherent noise can give Differential Privacy (DP) "for free". We will recap what we mean by HE, noise, and DP, before examining new results on the DP guarantees of the Approximate HE setting. We'll finish by applying our results to a case study: Ridge Regression Training via Gradient Descent.
