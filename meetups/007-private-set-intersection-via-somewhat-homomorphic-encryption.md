# Abstract
Somewhat/Fully Homomorphic Encryption (SHE/FHE) is a versatile tool for many cryptographic applications. In this talk, Ilia shows how to exploit SHE/FHE to build Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocols where two parties wish to compute the intersection of their respective private sets. He discusses the general framework of such protocols and the state-of-the-art optimizations including the results from ACM CCS’21.

# The speaker
Ilia Iliashenko is a research engineer from Ciphermode Labs. He obtained his PhD in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Frederik Vercauteren and Prof. Bart Preneel and then spend 2 years as a postdoctoral researcher at imec-COSIC, KU Leuven, Belgium. His research interests are focused on secure computation methods including fully/somewhat homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation. Ilia published 11 research papers on SHE/FHE that were/will be presented at major cryptographic conferences such as Eurocrypt, CHES and ACM CCS. In 2018 and 2019, Ilia was an intern at Microsoft Research, Redmond Lab, working on implementation of the CKKS/HEAAN scheme in the SEAL library.
