# Abstract

This presentation is about constructions of threshold fully homomorphic encryption with low communication, i.e., with small ciphertexts and small decryption shares. The talk will overview the technicalities for achieving full-fledged threshold FHE, and put forward limitations or attacks regarding prior works. Then, a partial solution will be described. This construction achieves low communication, at the cost of requiring a trusted party to randomize ciphertexts before decryption is performed.

This is based on a joint work with Damien Stehlé, published at Asiacrypt 2024.

# About the speaker

Alain Passelègue is a researcher at CryptoLab Inc., in Lyon, currently on leave from academia. He has worked on a broad spectrum of cryptography over the last 10 years. He has recently focused on lattice-based primitives, and specifically on fully homomorphic encryption and its applications over the last year.
