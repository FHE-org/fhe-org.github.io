# Abstract
Private information retrieval (PIR) lets you retrieve an item from a database without revealing which item you accessed. This query privacy guarantee holds even if the server is malicious. Efficient PIR systems are built using FHE, and are practical today for a variety of applications.

In this talk, I'll give a high-level overview of how PIR using FHE works, and then go in-depth on the real-world deployment challenges of PIR systems, and how we tackle them.

# The speaker
Samir Menon is a co-founder of Spiral Privacy, which uses FHE to enable private access to blockchain information. He previously worked at Yubico, and before that worked on PIR and libsnark as a student at Stanford.
