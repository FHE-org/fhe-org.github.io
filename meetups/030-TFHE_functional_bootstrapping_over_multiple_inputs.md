![030 Meetup cover](https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io/assets/37557436/1dc3c37d-463f-46de-a568-13c19fafb5a9)

# Abstract

The aim of the meetup is to discuss the abilities of functional bootstrapping to compute multi inputs functions. Any ways of improving our proposed method, any suggestion on other methods to compare ourselves to, and any discussion on similar subject are welcome.

# About the speaker

Pierre-Emmanuel Clet is a Phd student working at CEA. His subject of research is the applications of FHE to the computation of neural networks in the cloud. Currently, the focus of his research is to study the capabilities of functional bootstrapping to compute non polynomial functions.
