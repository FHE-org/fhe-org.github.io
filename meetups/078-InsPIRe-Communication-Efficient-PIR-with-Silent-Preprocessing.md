# Abstract

We present InsPIRe that is the first private information retrieval (PIR) construction simultaneously obtaining both high-throughput and low query communication while using silent preprocessing (meaning no offline communication).

# About the speaker

Rasoul is a fourth-year PhD candidate at the University of Waterloo and a member of the CrySP lab. His research focuses on the design and implementation of secure and private computation protocols tailored for real-world applications. In particular, he works on applications of Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation, with a focus on Private Information Retrieval. He has also contributed to projects on Private Set Intersection and Differential Privacy. His work has been published in top-tier venues such as USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, and ACM CCS.
