# Abstract

State-of-the-art schemes in Fully Homomorphic Encryption, like the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) one base their security on the Ring Learning with Errors assumption. The problem arising from this construction is the presence of a noise, growing as homomorphic operations are performed. For correctness, this error must be kept under a certain threshold, which yields to a lower bound on the ciphertext modulus. On the contrary, to guarantee security and efficiency, the same element is required to small. This trade-off makes the parameter selection a challenging task.

In line with the community efforts, our work aims at making FHE more practical and accessible, in order to have privacy-preserving data processing in real life. We propose the first average-case approach for the study of the noise in FV, improving substantially the state-of-the-art estimation. From it, we give closed formulas for the computation of the ciphertext modulus, in the most common circuits. Finally, we propose a user-friendly tool to automate the parameter selection, combining our results about correctness with the security known ones, generating ready-to-use code snippets.
