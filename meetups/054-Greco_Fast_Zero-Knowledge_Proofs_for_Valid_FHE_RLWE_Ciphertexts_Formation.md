![054 Meetup cover](https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io/assets/37557436/3265bf84-ff0f-4762-b840-3d3fc2823f4f)


# Abstract

The presentation aims to describe:

- why proofs of valid ciphertext formation are necessary
- main issues when wrapping FHE algorithms into zkSNARKs
- tricks used to overcome those while building Greco
- benchmarks of Greco

# About the speaker

Enrico is a researcher at PSE.  His earliest contributions were in identity-related privacy-preserving applications such as [designated verifier proof](https://github.com/enricobottazzi/designated-verifier-proof) and [zk-sbt](https://github.com/enricobottazzi/ZK-SBT).  He led the creation of [summa](https://github.com/summa-dev/summa-solvency), a production-ready proof of solvency solution for custodians. Lately, his research has focused on applications powered by Secure Multi-Party Computation. His first contribution to the space is Greco.
