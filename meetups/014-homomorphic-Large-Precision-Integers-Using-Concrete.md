![014 Meetup cover](https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io/assets/37557436/882d0449-7b36-4b6c-ad15-bfd8b7cfb01e)

# Abstract
To build real life applications with outsourced and secure computations, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) turns out to be a powerful tool.

Accordingly, FHE schemes must offer efficient implementation to ensure input precision. That way, the design of new data structures and information encoding strategies can be particularly suited for a given context.

In this talk, we will detail a few constructions of large integers based on the TFHE cryptosystem. We will also explore their theoretical aspects along with their implementations in the Concrete library.

# The speaker
Jean-Baptiste Orfila works at the intersection of homomorphic encryption, optimization and computer science applied to fast and secure outsourced computations. Recently, his research involves improving the homomorphic encryption scheme TFHE both in terms of precision and efficiency. He is currently researcher at Zama and formerly worked on secure multi-party computations, public key infrastructures and protocol security.
