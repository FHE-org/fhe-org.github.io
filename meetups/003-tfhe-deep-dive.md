# Abstract
TFHE is a fully homomorphic encryption scheme that enables fast homomorphic operations on booleans, integers and reals. By enabling both leveled and bootstrapped operations, TFHE can be used for a wide range of usecases, from homomorphic boolean circuits to homomorphic neural networks. In this talk, Ilaria will do a deep dive on TFHE, and explain the key concepts behind it.

# The speaker
Ilaria Chillotti is a researcher in cryptography, specialized in homomorphic encryption. Fascinated by enigmas and secrets, she studied mathematics at a young age in order to get closer to cryptography. She notably co-authored TFHE, currently one of the fastest homomorphic encryption scheme in the world.

She is the author of several publications, and winner of the "Best Paper Awards" at Asiacrypt 2016 as well as the iDASH competition in 2019.

Ilaria is currently Director of Research at Zama, and was previously doing her postdoc at KU Leuven. She holds a BSc from Cagliari University, a MSc from Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, and a PhD from Versailles Paris-Saclay.
