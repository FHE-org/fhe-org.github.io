# Abstract

Hybrid homomorphic encryption can effectively mitigate the ciphertext size expansion problem caused by full homomorphic encryption. Standardized AES homomorphic computation has been a challenge for the transciphering community.
In this talk, Benqiang Wei will present a low-latency homomorphic evaluation of AES based on the (leveled) TFHE scheme.

# About the speaker

Benqiang Wei is a final year PhD student at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. His research interests focus on the design and application of fully homomorphic encryption. He is advised by Xianhui Lu.
