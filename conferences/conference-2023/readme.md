The closest subway station is Onarimon Station. The venue tower is directly in front of exit A3a.

If you're coming from the airport, you can take the Keikyu airport line directly to Daimon station without needing to get off, then walk about 8 min. From the airport there are 2 subway ticket stations opposite each other seperated by an escalator. Look for the one that says "Keikyu line" above it. If it doesn't say that, go to the opposite side ticket office.

If you need assistance, feel free to reach out at contact@fhe.org.
