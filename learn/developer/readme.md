# Generalities


Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows you to run computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first. As a developer, this means you’re able to write code that doesn’t jeopardize the privacy of your users.

Benefits of using FHE in your applications as a developer can include:

- Demonstrating a commitment to data privacy and security to your users, and enhancing user trust in your application.
- Improving security by performing computations on cloud data without exposing to potential threats or unauthorized access.
- Ensuring that sensitive data remains protected even when third-party sharing is a required property of your application
- Complying with privacy regulations and standards by default

<br>


## Ideal Use Cases

Homomorphic encryption is ideal for some use cases more than others.

## Threat model

Homomorphic encryption is not a silver bullet for all use cases. As with all cryptography, how practical or safe it is to use is ultimately dependent on the use case, implementation, library, and underlying scheme.

<br>
<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Encryption Strength</td>
<td>The security of homomorphic encryption relies on the strength of the underlying encryption scheme. If the encryption scheme is compromised or broken, the encrypted data and computations could be exposed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Implementation Flaws</td>
<td>Like any cryptographic system, the implementation of homomorphic encryption algorithms and protocols may introduce vulnerabilities. Implementation flaws, such as programming errors or side-channel attacks, could potentially compromise the security of the encrypted data. It's important to have your code audited, use libraries that are audited, and also schemes that have been publicly tested and accepted by the community as safe.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Metadata Leakage</td>
<td>While homomorphic encryption protects the content of the data, it does not hide the metadata associated with the encrypted computations. Metadata leakage could enable attackers to infer information about the encrypted data, such as its size, access patterns, or the type of computations being performed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Key Management</td>
<td>Homomorphic encryption schemes typically require the management of encryption keys. Adequate key management practices, including key generation, distribution, storage, and revocation, are crucial to maintaining the security of the encrypted data.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<!-- Constraints section -->




# Constraints

There are several constraints regarding the implementation of homomorphic encryption-based solutions. Each of these constraints needs to be considered carefully when implementing an FHE-based solution.

### Choosing Parameters

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=1>
The target homomorphic encryption scheme needs to be initialized with parameters which are used throughout the computation. These parameters determine everything performance related: the security level, the efficiency of homomorphic operations, the size of key material, the input (and output) precision, how noise grows throughout the computation, and when a special operation called bootstrapping needs to be performed. We consider each of these issues below, one-by-one.
</td>

```

## Approximate vs Exact computation

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>
FHE schemes can be categorised in many ways. One of the most important distinctions is whether an FHE scheme is <b>exact</b> or <b>approximate</b>. In the first case computations are typically considered over the integers and correctness of output is guaranteed. In the latter case, a small error is incurred during computation, so that the output of a homomorphic function evaluation, such as computing `f(x)`, contains a small error: `f(x) + e`.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

## Input Precision

<table>

<tr>
<td colspan=2>
FHE schemes typically work over restricted input domains (for example: the integers modulo `p`). This means that when implementing an algorithm in FHE, it is important to consider whether the algorithm needs to be adapted to work over this domain. As an example, consider the `max()` function on real numbers: suppose that we want to compute the max of 0.001 and 8.764. Certain FHE schemes work modulo `p` (as mentioned above), so the first step is to figure out how to map our inputs, and the respective max algorithm, into this modular domain.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>


## Output Precision
<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>
For approximate schemes, such as CKKS, the homomorphic encryption scheme carries an implicit error which impacts the message. The parameters can be adapted to guarantee a specific output precision, but this is important to note when considering implementing solutions in CKKS.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>


## Speed

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>
The speed of FHE-based operations is constantly improving. However, there is still a large slow-down compared to plaintext operations, and it is important to consider this when getting started. There are a variety of open-source implementations of various algorithms implemented in FHE, and looking at benchmarks for these applications can give a good indication of where FHE is at.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>


## Object Sizes

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>
When data is encrypted using an FHE scheme, there is an expansion factor which needs to be considered. As an example, in the TFHE scheme, to encrypt somewhere in the order of 1-8 bits, a ciphertext will be of size 5 kilobytes. Evaluation keys, which are required for the server to carry out homomorphic operations over ciphertexts, can be very large. In particular, all evaluation keys stored on the server are just collections of ciphertexts, and can be in the order of tens of megabytes (or even over a gigabyte, in certain cases). This means that there is a high bandwidth requirement on FHE-based solutions.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>


## Noise and Bootstrapping

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>
As homomorphic operations are being computed, the level of noise contained in the utilised ciphertext grows. The noise level must not be allowed to overflow a specific bound, or errors can be introduced into computations. The process used to clear this noise is called bootstrapping, and, depending on the scheme, has a varying level of efficiency.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

## Security

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>
It is important that the homomorphic encryption scheme is parameterised correctly to ensure a sufficient level of security. The security is related a problem called Learning with Errors, and we need to choose cryptographic parameters such that this problem is hard to solve. Luckily, there are many FHE-based tools which take the problem of parameter selection away from the user. Moreover, most FHE libraries typically have default parameter sets for which the security level has already been determined.

# Schemes and Libraries



## Schemes
<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>

Schemes are the mathematical algorithms that are used for the underlying FHE operations on data. There are several major schemes implemented in modern libraries, each taking a different approach that has their own benefits and drawbacks on what types of operations can be done, the depth of calculations, and the resulting latency.

## Libraries

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>

Libraries are the software developers use to perform FHE operations easily, similarly to how one might use the `libsodium` library for basic cryptographic operations. Each library is designed for working with different schemes, some with multiple schemes and the ability to switch between them as needed.

## Choosing the right scheme/library

Choosing which library/scheme is right for you can be confusing at first, but here are some considerations that help in the decision making process:

* What data types will you working with? (Large integers? Small integers / Booleans? Real / Complex values?)
* How parralelizable is your workflow?
* How deep are your typical calculations?
* What performance requirements do you have?
* How easy do you need implementation to be?
* How much existing code / support will you need?

<i>In the following section, you'll have a chance to use existing sample code and write your own code. If at that point you're still unsure which library is right for you or have deeper questions about it the libraries and schemes, consider joining the [FHE.org community on Discord](https://discord.fhe.org) and asking the community directly. We're here to help!</i>
